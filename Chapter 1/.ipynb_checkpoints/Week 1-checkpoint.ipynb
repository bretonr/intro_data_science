    "Statistics is possibly the most useful and versatile tool that a physicist can master. In physics, or in any other field of experimental research for that matter, measurements are essentially always obtained with associated uncertainties. The interpretation of the results fundamentally depends on a proper statistical analysis of the data. Even outside of natural sciences statistics are crucial. Think about assessing the effectiveness of a new drug in medical sciences, or determining the best approach to dealing with health care deployment in social sciences. Computer scientists need to consider statistics, as numerical techniques bear inherent errors through, e.g., rounding off errors. If you are a pure 'theorist' you probably will not escape it either; remember Boltzmann's distribution?\n",

    "\n",
    "There is however some caution to exercise here. What might be the issues with the reported news? Here are the most important points:\n",
    "1. From the article (main body) we learn that 70% success rate is the median success rate of the study. The success rate for Stage I, Stage II and Stage III cancers are 43%, 73% and 78%, respectively.\n",
    "2. From the article (abstract) we learn that the specificity (i.e. false positive rate) of the test is 99.14%.\n",

    "> We want to calculate the chance of not getting a false positive in 40 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The chance of not being controlled as false positive in one year is $0.9914$. This means that the chance of not being controlled as false positive after 40 years is the product of the probabilities for each year: $0.9914^{40}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally, the chance of getting a false positive after 40 years is $1 - 0.9914^{40} = 0.29$.\n",

    "We can therefore see that if the entire population we subjected to systematic testing through this method, a lot of people would receive the bad news, while further testing would reveal they do not have cancer after all.

    "**Definition**: _Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis._ [Oxford Dictionary]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of data:\n",
    "- Qualitative / non-numeric: colour, preference food, feeling toward service quality\n",
    "- Quantitative / numeric: length of an object, decay rate of a particle, flux from a star\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data can be divided into two types:\n",
    "- Discrete data: number of photons detected, number of persons\n",
    "- Continuous data: potential difference, mass of galaxies\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative data are often difficult to analyse in a way that is practical for data science. For this reason, they are often 'translated' into quantitative (approximation) in order to enable them to be processed. An 'absolute' (or independent) quantitative measure is however sometimes difficult to obtain: a colour can be converted to RGB fairly easily, but a customer feelings on a scale of 0-10 is more arbitrary. The translation of qualitative to quantitative is in itself an entire field of research.\n",

    "#### Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance is a useful measure but has dimensions of $[x][y]$, which are not always easy to conceptualise. By normalising the covariance using the standard deviations of $x$ and $y$, we can obtain a dimensionless quantity, the *correlation*, which is often more practical:\n",

    "  \\rho = \\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation is therefore a number between -1 and +1. If $\\rho = 0$, there is no correlation between x and y; that is, the two variables are completely independent. If $\\rho > 0$, larger (i.e. more positive) values of $x$ imply a tendency for $y$ value to also be larger. If $\\rho < 0$, larger values of $x$ will tend to go with smaller (i.e. more negative) values of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of distributions, with the associated correlation coefficient. It is important to note that\n",
    "1. The correlation is not affected by the mean value of data points (i.e. it is translation invariant).\n",
    "2. The correlation reflects the coupling between the two quantities, but is independent of the slope due to the normalisation by the standard deviations (i.e. it is scale invariant). (Note the the middle figure has an undefined correlation due to $\\sigma_y = 0$.)\n",
    "3. The correlation does not capture nonlinear coupling between the parameters.\n",
